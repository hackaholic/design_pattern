ðŸš€ Step 1: What Are Design Patterns?

ðŸ“Œ Definition:
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They arenâ€™t code snippets but templates that help solve problems efficiently and cleanly.

âœ… Why Use Design Patterns?

    Avoid reinventing the wheel â€“ Solve common problems with reusable solutions.
    Improve code maintainability â€“ Clean, modular, and scalable code.
    Make code flexible â€“ Patterns allow easy modifications in the future.
    Better communication â€“ Instead of explaining logic, you can just say, "Use Singleton" or "This is an Observer."


# ðŸš€ Step 2: Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are divided into **3 major types**:

| Type         | Purpose                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Creational**  | How objects are created        |
| **Structural**  | How objects are arranged & related |
| **Behavioral**  | How objects interact & communicate |

ðŸ”¹ **Creational Patterns** â†’ Focus on **object creation.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Structural Patterns** â†’ Focus on **organizing objects.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Behavioral Patterns** â†’ Focus on **communication between objects.**
