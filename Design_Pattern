ðŸš€ Step 1: What Are Design Patterns?

ðŸ“Œ Definition:
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They arenâ€™t code snippets but templates that help solve problems efficiently and cleanly.

âœ… Why Use Design Patterns?

    Avoid reinventing the wheel â€“ Solve common problems with reusable solutions.
    Improve code maintainability â€“ Clean, modular, and scalable code.
    Make code flexible â€“ Patterns allow easy modifications in the future.
    Better communication â€“ Instead of explaining logic, you can just say, "Use Singleton" or "This is an Observer."


ðŸš€ Step 2: Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are divided into 3 major types:
Type	    Purpose
Creational	How objects are created
Structural	How objects are arranged & related
Behavioral	How objects interact & communicate

ðŸ”¹ Creational Patterns â†’ Focus on object creation.
ðŸ”¹ Structural Patterns â†’ Focus on organizing objects.
ðŸ”¹ Behavioral Patterns â†’ Focus on communication between objects.


Creational Patterns:

    Focus:
        How objects are created â€” itâ€™s about designing the process of how and when objects are created.

    Purpose:
        Manage object creation so that itâ€™s efficient, flexible, and controlled. You want to make sure objects are created in the right way, without exposing too much detail to the rest of the system.

    Key Ideas:
        Focus on creating objects in a way that minimizes complexity. You want to abstract the process of creation so that your system can easily change or extend without affecting other parts.

    Goal:
        Make sure that object creation is centralized, flexible, and consistent. It helps to avoid hard-coded object creation and makes it easier to add new objects or change the object creation process.

    Analogy:
        Itâ€™s like designing a factory to produce products. You donâ€™t want every part of the system to know how each product is made, you just want to give the factory a type of product and let it handle the rest. This way, if you need to change the way a product is made, you only need to update the factory, not the entire system.

    Real-World Example:
        Imagine you are designing a game. Instead of having the game directly create objects like players, weapons, and levels, you could use a Factory Pattern to handle the creation. This way, you can easily add new types of players or weapons without changing the game logic.

Structural Patterns:

    Focus:
        How classes and objects are arranged and related to one another â€” itâ€™s about building the architecture using classes.

    Purpose:
        Design the skeleton or frame of the system using classes. You decide how each part is connected and how they interact â€” whether that's through inheritance, composition, or other methods.

    Key Ideas:
        Organizing your classes and objects to form a well-structured system. Itâ€™s about making sure everything is connected and easy to scale.

    Goal:
        Structure the system, so itâ€™s ready for use and easy to maintain as it grows.

    Analogy:
        Think of it like building the architecture of a building â€” you decide the layout, the rooms, and how theyâ€™re connected. Once this is in place, you can build up functionality on top of it.

    Real-World Example:
        Imagine a file system. The directories (composite objects) hold files (leaf objects). You can have directories inside other directories. This is the structure of your system â€” classes and objects are connected in a certain way to organize and manage data.

Behavioral Patterns:

    Focus:
        Once the architecture (structure) is built, how do the objects communicate and interact with each other?

    Purpose:
        Itâ€™s about how objects work together â€” sharing information, performing actions, and collaborating to achieve a goal.

    Goal:
        Define the communication and interactions between objects.

    Analogy:
        Once the architecture of the building is set up, behavioral patterns are like how people move and interact within that space. Itâ€™s about how the buildingâ€™s components (rooms, doors, elevators, etc.) work together to allow for smooth functioning.

    Real-World Example:
        In a bank, after building the system structure, customers can interact with different services (check balance, transfer money, etc.). The communication between the customer and bank systems defines the behavior
