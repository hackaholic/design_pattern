Structural design patterns help organize classes and objects to form larger, more efficient, scalable, and flexible structures.

Here’s the list of Structural Patterns:

1️⃣ Adapter – Converts one interface into another.
2️⃣ Bridge – Separates abstraction from implementation.
3️⃣ Composite – Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
4️⃣ Decorator – Adds behavior dynamically to objects.
5️⃣ Facade – Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
6️⃣ Flyweight – Shares objects to reduce memory usage.
7️⃣ Proxy – Acts as a substitute or intermediary for another object.
